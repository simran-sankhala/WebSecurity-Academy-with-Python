## Disclaimer

This repository is for educational purposes only, and I am not responsible for using any of the techniques described here for illegal usage.

## Using Burp Suite for Labs

You can, of course, solve the labs using Burp Suite, but this repository is for those who want to take their scripting skills up to a higher level.

This repository assumes that you already know how to solve the labs and want to solve them using scripts in order to practice writing robust ones.
You may not find a detailed description of how the labs should be solved but you will find a detailed description of how the scripts were written.

## Trivial Labs

There are some labs that you may find trivial in their solutions and don't necessarily require a script. In fact, solving them without a script might be faster and easier. I have only written scripts for these labs for the completeness of this repository. Feel free to skip them if you prefer.

## Error Handling

Since this repository is intended for educational purposes and not for production, I have omitted some error handling, which I believe will not significantly impact your testing of the script. This decision represents a trade-off between addressing every possible scenario and prioritizing simplicity.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement while working with these scripts, feel free to open an issue.
Your feedback is valuable, and I appreciate your contributions to enhance the learning experience for everyone.

## Python Alternatives

If your goal is to quickly write a script, then Python will be your best friend. However, if you prioritize efficiency, seeking faster runtime and script robustness, there are better options available than Python

I recommend checking out the [WebSecurity Academy with Rust](https://github.com/elqal3awii/WebSecurity-Academy-with-Rust) repository in which I have solved the same labs using **Rust** in both single-threaded and multi-threaded programming approaches.

## Support & Star âœ¨
